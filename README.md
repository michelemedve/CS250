How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are first described using face to face interactions with the users, which I then break down into criteria that needs to be met by the product backlog. Creating user stories helps to organize each need into an idividual item that can be easily interpreted by all members of the team. User stories help identify specific functions and features that should be implemented into a program. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs as a large task that should be broken down into smaller pieces to produce the best possible product. I hope to incorporate Scrum frameworks and sprints into my future development work as opposed to the current waterfall methods of planning almost 100%, development, and then testing. The agile process of simultaneously testing and developing is what I hope to incorporate into my future development work as well. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being a focused, active participant and a good communicator. A good team member should meet deadlines and be vocal about impediments that would slow down progress to a project. A good team member should also listen to other team members and offer assistance when needed.
